	   Purpose:
			Can we write all of the code of the entire project inside main method?
				If we do that, 
					the code cannot be maintained
					the code is not reusable
					the code is not readable
						so, we will have multiple classes and multiple methods (User defined functions)
		Interview Perspective:
			None
		Next Steps:
			How to write user defined functions
			What does it really mean by Objects
