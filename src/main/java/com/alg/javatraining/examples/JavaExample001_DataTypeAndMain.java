			what is main method
			what is the entry point of execution
			java is a case sensitive language
			java has keywords
			Datatype and Variables in Java
		Interview Perspective:
			None
		Next Steps:
			Can we write all of the code of the entire project inside main method?
				If we do that, 
					the code cannot be maintained
					the code is not reusable
					the code is not readable
						so, we will have multiple classes and multiple methods (User defined functions)
